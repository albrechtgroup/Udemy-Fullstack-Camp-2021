    <h1>Devon Rex</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The Devon Rex is a breed of intelligent, tall-eared, short-haired cat that emerged in England during the late 1950s. They are known for their slender bodies, wavy coat, and large ears. This breed of cat is capable of learning difficult tricks but can be hard to motivate. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

    <h2>Breed History</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The Devon Rex is a breed of cat with a curly, very soft short coat similar to that of the Cornish Rex. They are often thought of as one of the most hypoallergenic cats available because of their type of coat. However, they are technically not hypoallergenic.

        The first Devon was discovered by Beryl Cox[1] in Buckfastleigh, Devon, UK, in 1959.[2] The breed was initially thought to be linked with the Cornish Rex; however, test mating proved otherwise.[2]

    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Hair</h3>
    <p>
        Cats have three types of hair: guard hair, awn hair, and down hair. The Devon Rex's coat is unusual because there is little guard hair. See Cornish Rex and Sphynx for more information on hair-deficient genetics in cats.
    </p>
    <p>
        The curl in Devon Rex fur is caused by a different mutation and gene than that of the Cornish Rex and German Rex, and breeding of a Devon with either of those cats results in cats without rexed (curled) fur. Devons, which are medium-sized cats, are often called "pixie cats" or "alien cats" because of their unique appearance
    </p>
    <h3>Other Characteristics</h3>
    <p>
        Their uncommonly large, slightly rounded ears are set low on the sides of their wide heads, their eyes are large, and their noses are slightly upturned. Unlike most cats, their whiskers are very short and often curled to such an extent that it may appear as if they have no whiskers. Their body type is distinctly lightly built. Their long, sturdy legs are well suited for long leaps, and their toes are unusually large.
